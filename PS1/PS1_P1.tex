\section*{Problem 1}
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] Suppose we consider the two draws sequentially. The prior likelihood for the yellow M\&M coming from the 1996 bag vs. the 1994 bag is $P(1994)=P(1996)=0.5$. That is, before the draw, it is equally likely to come from either bag. The \textit{likelihood} of the yellow M\&M coming from the 1994 bag is simply the fractional percentage of yellow M\&M's in the bag, $P(Y|1994)=0.20$. Likewise, $P(Y|1996)=0.14$. For the green $M\&M$ we adopt identical priors (i.e. equal probability of coming from either bag), and here use the fractional percentage of green M\&M's, $P(G|1994)=0.10$ and $P(G|1996)=0.20$. Thus, the posterior probabilities are the prior times the likelihood, $P(1994|Y)=P(1994)P(Y|1994)=0.5\times0.2=0.01$ and $P(1996|Y)=P(1996)P(Y|1996)=0.5\times0.14=0.07$. For the green M\&M, $P(1994|G)=0.05$ and $P(1996|G)=0.1$.\par \indent
	 Suppose we carry out the experiment and get a yellow $M\&M$ and a green $M\&M$. Since we draw one M\&M from each bag, we know that only \textit{one} can come from the 1994 bag, and the other \textit{must} come from the 1996 bag. The relative probability of the yellow M\&M coming from the 1994 bag rather than the 1996 bag is
\begin{align}
\frac{P(1994|Y,G)}{P(1996|Y,G)}&=\frac{P(1994|Y)P(1996|G)}{P(1996|Y)P(1994|G)}\\
&=\frac{0.10\times0.10}{0.07\times0.05} \\
&=2.86
\end{align}
or roughly three times more likely to have come from the 1994 bag.
\item[(b)] The \textit{normalized} probability is simply the posterior divided by the evidence, where the evidence is given by
\begin{align}
P(Y,G)&=P(1994|Y,G)+P(1996|Y,G)\\
&= 0.0135
\end{align}
Thus, the normalized probability is
\begin{align}
P(1994|Y,G)&=\frac{P(1994|Y)P(1996|G)}{P(Y,G)}\\
&= \frac{0.10\times0.10}{0.0135}\\
&= 0.74
\end{align}
or a 74\% chance.
	 
\end{enumerate}
